# Consolidation of Auraxian Information (CAI)

## A Planetside 2 stat site.

### https://planetside.isreally.fun

CAI is a WIP stat site that aims to provide quick access to live game data. The website currently offers a character 
session tracker, and provides session history up to a certain point in time. (As of writing, data is recorded from July
22, 2023 to the present).

This project is still in its early stages, so input from users is very welcome :)

### Tools

CAI uses [Daybreak Games' Census API](https://census.daybreakgames.com/") and 
[Event Streaming Service](https://census.daybreakgames.com/#what-is-websocket") to collect in-game information. The 
application is built with the awesome [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/">) programming language, and the website is made 
with [Phoenix LiveView.]("https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view").

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! You can report bugs and request features under [issues](https://github.com/Bentheburrito/cai/issues).
If you know Elixir, PRs are welcome too! If you want to implement a feature, please create an issue for it first.
